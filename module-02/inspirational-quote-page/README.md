# Inspirational Quote Page

[PLACE_FOR_YOUR_IMAGE]

[Demo](https://cute-clafoutis-9194d9.netlify.app/)

The Inspirational Quote Page is a single-page web app that displays a random quote on a random background image. Simply reload the page to get a new & inspiring quote!  
I completed this project as a review of web development basics, as well as a pretext for exploring the `webpack` code bundler.  
The result is a very simple application based on a combination of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, implemented with a highly (over-)engineered configuration.

# Technologies in use / Tech Stack / Built with

  - HTML/CSS/JS
  - Node.js
  - Webpack

# Installation

To install the Inspirational Quote Page, please follow the steps below:
  1. Clone the repo to your machine
  2. In the root folder, install all the dependencies with `npm i` / `yarn`
  3. Create an empty _/dist_ directory in the root folder
  4. The project can be run in one of two ways:
    - `npm start` - running the local version
    - `npm run build` - building the bundled code and storing the files in the /dist directory

# What I have learned

In addition to providing valuable practice adding interactivity to web pages using plain JavaScript, this project introduced me to the use of bundlers. I spent a lot of time going through the Webpack [Guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/) and experimenting with different functionalities and plugins.  
In doing so, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript module compiling, and how it can be used to manage dependencies and assets.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

[Tell what was hard in the process of building the project. Tell about where have you feel stuck and how did you overcome this.]

**Example:**

When I tried to connect to the third-party API, I was not sure how to use fetch and what is the difference between async/await, what are Promises and how to use them. After some Googling I found out the MDN documentation about async/await and tried to use it in practice - it worked!
