# What I have learned

While working on the Movie Watchlist I learned the fundamentals of asynchronous Javascript, and how to use the async/await syntax.
I struggled when dealing with asynchronous API calls made inside a for loop. Only after some Googling did I learn about the Promise.all() method from the MDN documentation for handling arrays of Promise instances.
