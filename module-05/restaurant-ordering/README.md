# What I have learned

This purpose of building Jimmy's Diner Restaurant Ordering app was to learn and perfect the use of fundamental JavaScript functionalities such as array methods (forEach, map, join), localStorage object storing/retrieval, and the dataset property. I also discovered the &lt;dialog&gt; tag which I use for emplementing the checkout modal.
