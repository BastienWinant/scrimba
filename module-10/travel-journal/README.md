# My Travel Journal

My Travel Journal is a web application to share and relive your favorite trips around the world!

The app shows a list of renowned tourist destinations with photo, description, and Google Maps link.

# What I have learned

While building the My Travel Journal App, I learned about data flow patterns between components in React. I read about the differences between external props data, and internal state data. A combination of both is used in the app to implement the interactive behavior of clickable cards.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

In order to implement the user click interactivity on the page, I had to look beyond props and read about React hooks. After going through the official React documentation, I learned about component state management and the useState hook for sharing data between sibling components.
After some trial and error, I was able to use the useState hook to dynamically update the display upon user click events!
